# Repository Guidelines

## Agent Workflow

- Start from the root `Justfile` unless you have a clear reason to drop into a subproject.
- Prefer `just api ...` and `just ui ...` over ad hoc commands.
- Keep changes scoped to the relevant project instead of mixing backend, frontend, deployment, and release edits in one pass.
- Target `develop`, not `main`.
- First prove the change with targeted tests around the edited surface, then run the wider suite for that surface before handing off.
- If you cannot run the wider suite, say exactly what you ran, what you skipped, and why.

## Project Structure

- **Backend (`booklore-api/`)**
  - Application code: `src/main/java`
  - Resources and Flyway migrations: `src/main/resources`
  - Tests: `src/test/java`
- **Frontend (`frontend/`)**
  - Application code: `src/app/{core,features,shared}`
  - Translations: `src/i18n/`
  - Assets: `src/assets/`

## Ownership Boundaries

- `deploy/`, `packaging/`, `tools/`, `docs/`, and `assets/` are support surfaces. Do not change them unless the task actually touches deployment, packaging, release automation, or shared docs/assets.
- Keep backend, frontend, deployment, and release work separated unless the task genuinely crosses those boundaries.
- When a change spans multiple surfaces, validate each one explicitly.

## Command Surface

Use these first:

```bash
just check          # run backend + frontend verification
just test           # run backend + frontend tests
just api run        # start Spring Boot with the dev profile
just api test       # run backend tests
just ui dev         # start the Angular dev server
just ui check       # run frontend verification
```

## Backend Rules

- Use 4-space indentation and match surrounding Java style.
- Prefer constructor injection via Lombok patterns already used in the codebase. Do not introduce `@Autowired` field injection.
- Use MapStruct for entity/DTO mapping.
- Keep JPA entities on the `*Entity` suffix.
- Add Flyway migrations as new files named `V<number>__<Description>.sql`.
- Do not edit released migrations in place.
- Prefer focused unit tests; use `@SpringBootTest` only when the Spring context is required.

## Frontend Rules

- Use 2-space indentation in TypeScript, HTML, and SCSS.
- Keep Angular code on standalone components. Do not add NgModules.
- Prefer `inject()` over constructor injection.
- Follow `frontend/eslint.config.js`: component selectors use `app-*`, directive selectors use `app*`, and `any` is disallowed.
- Put user-facing strings in Transloco files under `frontend/src/i18n/`.
- Keep responsive behavior intact.
- Use Vitest for tests.

## Validation

- Use staged verification: prove the behavior locally with targeted tests first, then run the wider suite for that surface.
- Typical backend path: `just api test` and then `just api check`.
- Typical frontend path: targeted Vitest coverage for the changed area and then `just ui check`.
- If the change crosses frontend and backend boundaries, finish with a repo-level pass such as `just test` or `just check`.
- Do not claim completion from a narrow test when a broader runnable suite exists.

## PR Expectations

- If UI behavior changes, capture screenshots or a short recording for the PR.
- PRs in this repo are expected to link an approved issue and include local test output.
- Follow Conventional Commits with scopes, for example `feat(devex): ...` or `fix(entrypoint): ...`.

## unRAID Calibre Deployment Notes

- Current Grimmory primary library: `/mnt/m2cache/grimmory-test/CalibreLibrary-GrimmoryTest`
- Retained legacy Calibre library for rollback only: `/mnt/m2cache/calibre-cleanup-0326/CalibreLibrary-New`
- Direct LAN SSH fallback for the unRAID host: `ssh root@192.168.1.101`
- Retained Calibre access during rollback window:
  - Calibre-Web: `http://100.85.214.86:8083`
  - Calibre desktop admin: `https://100.85.214.86:8181`
- Existing unRAID container defaults from the live Calibre stacks:
  - `PUID=99`
  - `PGID=100`
  - `TZ=Europe/London`
- Grimmory is now the source of truth for the primary library on unRAID.
- Do not write to the retained legacy Calibre tree during the rollback window.
- Grimmory BookDrop remains a sibling of the primary library, not inside the library root:
  - `/mnt/m2cache/grimmory-test/bookdrop`
- Do not design or deploy a steady-state shared-write setup between Calibre and Grimmory.
- MAM/qBittorrent ingestion remains part of the primary Grimmory flow:
  - seeding root: `/mnt/m2cache/MAM-QBTorrent`
  - new-completion hardlinks into `/mnt/m2cache/grimmory-test/bookdrop`
  - qBittorrent immediate hook: `/config/scripts/request_bookdrop_link.sh "%L" "%F" "%I" "%N"`
  - host request watcher: `/mnt/user/appdata/MAM-QBTorrent/scripts/watch_bookdrop_requests.sh`
  - host catchall reconciler: `/mnt/user/appdata/MAM-QBTorrent/scripts/reconcile_bookdrop_from_qbit.sh`
  - MAM Dynamic Seedbox updater: `/mnt/user/appdata/MAM-QBTorrent/scripts/update_mam_dynamic_seedbox.sh`
  - persistent cron: `/boot/config/plugins/dynamix/grimmory-bookdrop-qbit.cron`
- Keep MAM hardlinks host-side. Docker cannot hardlink between the separate `/downloads` and `/bookdrop` bind mounts even when the host paths are on the same btrfs filesystem.
- MouseSearch runs on OCI, but `MAM-QBTorrent` announces from unRAID. If MAM reports `Unrecognized host/PassKey`, update Dynamic Seedbox from unRAID with the qB-specific updater; do not enable MouseSearch's OCI-side dynamic IP updater for this client.
- Put linked files directly in the BookDrop root. Grimmory watches `/bookdrop` and only scans subdirectories immediately when a new top-level directory is created; a long-lived `/bookdrop/books` folder can delay detection until periodic rescan.
- Marker files under `/mnt/user/appdata/MAM-QBTorrent/scripts/bookdrop-linked.d/` mean "linked into BookDrop", not "imported into Grimmory".
- If rollback is required, re-enable exactly one Calibre-side writer against the retained legacy tree:
  - Calibre-Web
  - full Calibre desktop
  - `calibredb` or tag refresh scripts
  - enrichment or recovery scripts
- The rebuilt-library handover reported:
  - total books: `3576`
  - books with ISBN: `2287`
  - books still without ISBN: `1289`
- Treat those counts as reference points for validation, not exact Grimmory acceptance criteria.
- `AGENTS.md` already has local user edits in this worktree. Merge carefully and do not overwrite unrelated changes.
